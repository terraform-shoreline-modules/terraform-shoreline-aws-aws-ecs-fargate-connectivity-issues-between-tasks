  "description": "This incident type involves connectivity issues between tasks in an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster that uses service discovery. Service discovery is a mechanism that allows services to be discovered and accessed by other services without needing to know their IP addresses. There are several potential areas to investigate when facing connectivity issues, including service discovery configuration, DNS resolution, task definition and network mode, security groups, task IAM role, VPC configuration, ECS agent, ECS service event messages, logs, application-level configuration, and health checks. Troubleshooting steps need to be taken to resolve these issues.",
